2.1.1:
It takes many iterations before errors are seen because the number of iterations
increases the chance that more than one thread accessing the shared resource (counter)
at the same time causing the race condition.
A significantly smaller number of iterations seldom fail since the probability of
multiple threads entering the critical section at the same time is significantly low 
which means much less chance for race condition to happen.

2.1.2:
The average cost per operation equals the total run time divided by the number of
operation so the average cost per operation drops with increasing iterations. Also
thread creation is expensive but by having many iterations the cost become
insignificant.
If the cost per operation is a function of the number of iterations we can have the
number of iterations to go to infinity and when the cost converges, we know we have
the 'correct' cost (or how many iterations to run).
